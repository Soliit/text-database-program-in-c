# text-database-program-in-c
- A program with CREATE and READ functions without a normal database, the data is stored on a txt file, enjoy! ãƒ„ . Made for a college task (IFSP)
- In case you wanna test it, you don't need the "employees.txt" file, the programs create the .txt only if you register the employees.
